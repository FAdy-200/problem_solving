# Problem Solving Repository

This repository contains my solutions for various programming problems I have solved through out the years across different websites such as LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces. The majority of these solutions are implemented in Python, newer solutions will be in C++.

## Structure

Each problem solution is contained within its own folder and includes a README file describing the problem and my approach to solving it. Within each folder, you will find the code file(s) and any necessary input files or test cases.

### Folders

The folders are organized by problem category or website:

- `leetcode/`: Solutions for LeetCode problems.
- `hackerrank/`: Solutions for HackerRank problems.
- `codeforces/`: Solutions for Codeforces problems.
- `misc/`: Solutions for miscellaneous problems or challenges.
- `USEFUL_CODES/`: Some Python custom data structures.

## Usage

Feel free to use this repository as a reference or resource for your own problem-solving journey. However, please do not copy and paste the solutions as your own. The purpose of this repository is to showcase my own problem-solving abilities and provide insight into my coding style and approach.
